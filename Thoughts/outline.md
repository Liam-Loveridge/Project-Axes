# Outline of Project: Axes
A general purpose graphing tool in Python.

## Rough project outline
1. Create standard program that graphs a simple graph where all data is hardwired into it.
2. Create different axes methods
3. Refactor code to be modular
4. Allow for user to input data
5. Add command line arguments
6. Allow for files to be inputted/output from user
7. Package up so that a text based application can be used in any directory
8. GUI interface

## Future Idea
Here are some future ideas for the project
* variable best fit line
* use different methods for regression lines
* output useful items to a text file or markdown?
* allow the user to create a config file for Python
